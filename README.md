# Doctor-Who-Title-sequence-svg
An SVG animation made inspired by the Doctor Who title sequence created using Haskell as part of my Functional Programming coursework.

It makes use of an animation library (included) provided by the module lecturer. 
Most of the files are the code needced to create the animation, but the SVG filkes are the animations themselves. 
The finished product is 'animation'.svg'.
If you want to edit and then compile the hs code files then you need to install WinGHCI. Any code or text editor will do for the hs files.
The SVG file can be open in a browser to see the animation. Just download it and open it.
